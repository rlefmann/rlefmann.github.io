# rlefmann.github.io

This is my [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) website.

The website is generated by a simple [makefile](https://github.com/rlefmann/rlefmann.github.io/blob/master/src/makefile).

## Usage

* Create new pages inside the `src` directory.
* Blog posts are located in the `src/posts` directory and their filename starts with their publishing date in format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
* When you have finished writing, type `make` to build the website.
* To push the changes to GitHub, just type `make publish`, write a commit message and enter your GitHub login credentials.
